A while back, I came across this idea in a research article
If you want to truly master any topic, you should revise it after
1, 3, 7, 14, 30, 90, 180, and 365 days

Makes sense, right?
But here’s the catch try doing it for every topic you learn.
You’ll spend more time calculating dates and updating your calendar than actually revising.

That’s when I thought..
What if I could build something that does all of that for me?

so I’ve started building a revision tracker website in which u just have to add topic u learned today and then check the topics u have to revisie that day.
It’s still in its early days, but here’s what it can do right now:

Add a topic from the frontend ✅

Store all its spaced-revision dates in the backend ✅

Calculates the dates after 1-3-7-14-30-90-100-365 ✅

What’s coming next?

Display those dates right in the UI under each topic box

And the part I’m most excited about… AI Mode 🤖

It can quiz you on your topics

Warn you when a day is overloaded with too many revisions

Suggest which topics you can skip or remove.
